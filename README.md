DevBridge Standard Web Project Template (http://www.devbridge.com)
=======================================================================
## Why
Our Standard Web Project Template serves two purposes: to share expertise between developers and to make easier for new team members to setup new web application in right way. Since here in DevBridge we believe in open communication we are not afraid to share our knowledge with the rest of the world.

## Note
Please keep in mind that not all projects are equal so this template may not suit well for your project (don’t copy blindly rather adopt parts that you find useful).

## Where To Start
Get StandardWebProjectTemplate source code on your machine and compile it.
Create StandardWebProjectTemplate SQL database on your local machine or remove server and apply SQL scripts from [Solution]\DevBridge.Templates.WebProject.DatabaseChanges\Update\ folder. If you use remote SQL server please adjust hibernate-configuration.config files to use remote SQL server as data source.
Run tests - all tests should pass.
Run DevBridge.Templates.WebProject.Web project - it should start demo web project.
