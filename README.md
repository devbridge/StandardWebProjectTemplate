DevBridge Standard Web Project Template (http://www.devbridge.com)
=======================================================================
Our Standard Web Project Template serves two purposes: to share expertise between developers and to make it easier for new team members to setup new web applications correctly. Here at DevBridge, we believe in open communication and like to share our knowledge with others who may find it helpful. 

Please, keep in mind that not all projects are equal. This template may not be suited for your project (don’t copy blindly rather adopt parts that you find useful).

## Where To Start
1. Take a look at [blog post](http://www.devbridge.com/articles/devbridge-standard-web-project-template-part-1/).
2. Get the StandardWebProjectTemplate source code on your machine and compile it.
3. Create StandardWebProjectTemplate SQL database on your local machine or remote server and apply SQL scripts from [Solution]\DevBridge.Templates.WebProject.DatabaseChanges\Update\folder. If you use a remote SQL server please adjust hibernate-configuration.config files to use the remote SQL server as the data source.
4. Run tests - all tests should pass.
5. Run DevBridge.Templates.WebProject.Web project - it should start the demo web project.
